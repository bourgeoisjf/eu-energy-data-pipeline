# European Energy Market Insights: End-to-End Pipeline of Real-Time Energy Data (ENTSO-E) - v2.0

![Airflow DAG Success](assets/airflow-dag-success-graph.jpg)

An automated, end-to-end **Data Engineering Pipeline** that ingests, processes, and analyzes real-time electricity data from the **ENTSO-E API**. 

This version introduces **Workflow Orchestration with Apache Airflow**, dynamic data partitioning, and a robust multi-country/multi-type (Generation & Prices) architecture.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The pipeline follows a modern **Medallion-like Architecture** (Raw → Processed → Enriched) orchestrated by Airflow:

1.  **Extraction (Bronze):** Ingests multi-country XML data (Generation & Prices) via REST API.
2.  **Parsing (Silver):** Converts complex XML namespaces into structured, partitioned CSVs.
3.  **Enrichment (Gold):** Maps technical codes to human-readable reference data (PSR Types, Countries).
4.  **Loading:** Upserts clean data into **PostgreSQL** using `ON CONFLICT` logic for idempotency.
5.  **Analytics:** Ready for **Power BI / Streamlit** consumption.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow (DAGs, Task Monitoring, Backfilling).
* **Language:** Python 3.11+ (Pandas, Requests, Psycopg2).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational Storage & Time-series data).
* **Infrastructure:** Docker & Docker-Compose (Ready for deployment).
* **Data Source:** ENTSO-E Transparency Platform API.

## 🐳 Dockerization

The project is fully containerized to ensure environment consistency and easy deployment. The `docker-compose.yaml` orchestrates:

* **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage for enriched energy data.
* **Airflow Scheduler**: Handles the logic and timing of the ETL tasks.
* **Airflow Webserver**: Provides the UI for monitoring and management.
* **Airflow Init**: Handles database migrations and user creation.
  
## ⚡ Key Features

* **Dynamic Backfilling**: Leveraging Airflow's `catchup=True` to recover historical data automatically.
* **SLA & Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of task duration and latency analysis.
* **Idempotency**: Scripts are designed to be re-run for the same date without duplicating data in PostgreSQL.
* **Multi-Category Support**: Integrated processing for both **Electricity Generation** and **Day-Ahead Prices**.

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

We utilize Airflow's **Task Duration** metrics to ensure pipeline health and monitor API latency, ensuring our **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** for data availability is met.

## 🚀 Pipeline Flow

The workflow is organized in a linear dependency to ensure data integrity:

    A[Download XML] --> B[Parse XML to CSV]
    B --> C[Enrich Data]
    C --> D[Load to Postgres]
```

![Dashboard European Energy Market Insights](assets/ENTSO-E-Dashboard.jpg)

1. **Download**: Fetches data based on the Airflow `execution_date`.
2. **Parse**: Extracts values from XML namespaces into daily partitioned folders.
3. **Enrich**: Merges technical PSR codes with human-readable labels.
4. **Load**: Performs a batch `INSERT` into PostgreSQL with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
